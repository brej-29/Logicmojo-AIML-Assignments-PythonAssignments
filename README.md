## **Overview**

This repository contains three beginner-friendly Python projects designed to help practice programming fundamentals and user input handling:

- **Calculator:** A command-line calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
- **Guessing Game:** An interactive number guessing game with multiple difficulty levels.
- **To-Do List:** A simple CLI to-do list app to manage your daily tasks.
- **File Organizer:** A simple python program that groups files in a directory based on their extensions.
- **Manual ChatBot:** A simple, rule-based chatbot that responds to predefined user inputs.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x

### **Installation**
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/brej-29/Logicmojo-AIML-Assignments-PythonAssignments.git

cd Logicmojo-AIML-Assignments-PythonAssignments

### **Usage**
Run any project using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

python Calculator.py  
python GuessingGame.py  
python ToDoList.py  
python FileOrganizer.py
python ManualChatBot.py

## **Project Details**

### **Calculator**
A simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. Handles invalid input and division by zero gracefully.

### **Guessing Game**
A number guessing game where you select a difficulty level and try to guess a randomly chosen number within a range. The game provides feedback on each guess and counts your attempts.

### **To-Do List**
A command-line to-do list manager. Add tasks, view all tasks with their status, and mark tasks as done. Handles invalid input and ensures a smooth user experience.

### **File Organizer**
A script to organize files within a specified directory into subfolders based on their file extensions. It automatically creates folders for each file type (e.g., `jpg_files`, `pdf_files`) and moves the files accordingly. Files without an extension are placed in a `No_Extension` folder.

### **Manual ChatBot**
A simple, rule-based chatbot that responds to predefined user inputs. It demonstrates basic dictionary usage and conditional logic to simulate a conversation.
